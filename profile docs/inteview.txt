I use desktop, My pet cat dropped webcam 2 days ago, so it went broken, it doesnt work anymore.
Here, due to the COVID-19, all peoples' activies are strictly restricted, so I need a few days to buy new one.


Let me introduce myself first.
I am a full-stack developer with more than 6 years of development career.
As you can see in my CV, I have worked for many companies, which means good career.

What's highlight in my career is the development of products which were uploaded to themeforest.net.
You know, all products in themeforest are guaranteed in the sense of code quality, design and many developers like to purchase products there.
Even though making world-class products is demanding, I successfully made it with my team members.
I am boastful of myself in some sense.

There are mainly 3 products in themeforest.net I worked on.

- html product
